Clojure is a functional, dynamic, general-purpose programming language. It provides built-in concurrency support via software transactional memory and asynchronous agents, and offers a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. Clojure runs on JVM, JavaScript VMs, and Common Language Runtime.
